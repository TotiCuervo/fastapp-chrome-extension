# There are no dependencies to install for a browser extension from a manifest.json file.
# Browser extensions are installed directly into the browser and not run from the command line.

# However, if you want to load the unpacked extension into Chrome for testing, follow these steps:

# 1. Open Chrome browser
# 2. Navigate to chrome://extensions/
# 3. Enable Developer mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner
# 4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button
# 5. Select the directory containing your extension's code (including the manifest.json file)
